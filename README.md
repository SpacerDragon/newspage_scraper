# newspage_scraper
Simple webscraper written in python for getting news on email.

Modify it to suit your needs.

When I get the time I will add a function for checking if the article
is behind a paywall, and skip it. But that's for later. And I'll loose 
some of the functionality that way.

I never read news or newspapers, so I decided to make this app, 
to send me the headlines from certain news pages on e-mail.
This allows me to at least know a little of what's going on in the world.
